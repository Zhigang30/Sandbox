# Reflection

## 1. Accuracy of Estimates:
My accuracy in estimating practical tasks varied throughout the course of the subject. Initially, I struggled with
accurately predicting the time and effort required for each task. However, as I gained more experience and familiarity 
with the subject, my accuracy gradually improved. From doing the estimates, I learned the importance of 
breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable components and considering potential roadblocks or dependencies.

## 2. Code Reviews:
From both being reviewed and doing reviews, I learned the value of constructive criticism and collaboration in improving
code quality. Being reviewed helped me identify blind spots and areas for improvement in my code, while doing reviews 
allowed me to critically analyze others' code, learn new techniques, and contribute to the overall quality of the 
project.

## 3. Practical Tasks Overall:
If I were in charge of the subject, I would consider implementing more frequent peer reviews or pair programming 
sessions to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among students. Additionally, providing more structured feedback 
on estimates and code reviews could help students better understand their strengths and areas for improvement.
